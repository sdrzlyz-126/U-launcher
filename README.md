### Run Ulauncher on startup

If your distribution uses [Systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) and the packages includes [ulauncher.service](ulauncher.service), then you can run `ulauncher` on startup by running:

```
systemctl --user enable --now ulauncher
```

If not, then you can open Ulauncher and enable "Launch at Login" in the preferences.


### Known Issues and workarounds

* If you get a black box or border a border around the Ulauncher window, it's likely because your compositor or desktop environment doesn't support shadows. Try turning them off from the settings. For Sway in particular you may need to follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Ulauncher/Ulauncher/issues/230#issuecomment-570736422)
* [Can't map the keys to ALT+SPACE](https://github.com/Ulauncher/Ulauncher/issues/100)
* [Hotkey doesn't work in Wayland when is triggered from certain apps](https://github.com/Ulauncher/Ulauncher/issues/183)
